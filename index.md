# Eiman Siddiqui

I'm a _Chief of Staff_ for [State Representative Tom Oliverson](http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=130). I have over two sessions of experience in the Texas Legislature and have passed over 20 pieces of legislation. My policy specializations include healthcare, insurance, taxation and public education. 

I am also a member of the _Austin Global Shapers_ and work on projects that benefit the Austin community. Our current efforts are at understanding the affordable housing system in Austin and how to improve programs to benefit low income and displaced populations.
