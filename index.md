# Eiman Siddiqui

I'm a _Chief of Staff_ for [State Representative Tom Oliverson](http://www.house.state.tx.us/members/member-page/?district=130). I have worked in the Texas Legislature for 6 years and have worked on and passed over 50 pieces of legislation. During my time at the legislature, I have developed policy solutions benefiting all Texans. The policy areas I mostly focus on include _healthcare, insurance, tax, emerging technologies, land development and higher education_. Check out the work tab to learn more about my work on surprise medical billing, drug transparency, drone regulations, freestanding emergency rooms and college affordibility + equity.   

I am also currently the Curator of the _Austin Global Shapers_. We work on local projects with a global mindset aimed at improving the Austin community. Our current projects are focused on tackling food scarcity in low-income Austin areas. We previously worked on understanding the affordable housing system in Austin and how to improve programs to benefit low income and displaced populations. 

I am a public speaker and passionate about citizens getting involved in their government. I am always happy to talk to people/groups/organziations about Texas politics, youth mobilization and activism, lobbying/advocacy and more. I am lucky to have spoken on panels ranging from panels on catalyzing multistakeholder action at the World Economic Forum moderated by founder Klaus Schaub to my neighborhood policy talks on healthcare. 
Feel free to contact me to speak at your next event!
