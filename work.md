# Texas Legislature

Currently Chief of Staff for State Rep. Tom Oliverson. Previously policy analyst and capitol director for Rep. Jim Murphy and Rep. Rick Galindo



Senate Bill 1264 by Sen. Hancock and Rep. Oliverson eliminates most _Surprise Medical Billing_ for Texans with state regulated health insurance plans. The bill prevents patients from getting balanced billed while creating a dispute resolution process using arbitration for healthcare professionals and mediation for facilities. The Texas legislature overwhelmingly passed SB 1264 which was a product of significant stakeholder input and support.

     + includes all services and facilities except ground and air ambulance
     
     + arbitrators consider the median in-network rates and 80th percentile billed charges
     
     + patients are protected from balance bills
     
     
House Bill 2536 by Rep. Oliverson and Sen. Hancock required _Drug Price Transparency_ by drug manufacturers, pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. The bill is one of the strongest pieces of transparency legislation in the nation and requires drug manufacturers to report if they increase drug prices over 15% in a year. The bill also requires PBM's to disclose their drug rebate revenue. 



Over the course of the 85th and the 86th sessions, I worked on multiple pieces of legislation to create strong _Freestanding Emergency Room Consumer Protections_. The legislation focused on ensuring patients at freestanding ERs would not be confused about their insurance coverage as they were experiencing an emergency. 



During the 84th session, I created the first framework for _Drone Regulations_ restricting airspace for drones over certain critical infrastructure sites. HB 1481 by Rep. Murphy and Sen. Birdwell was the initial legislation restricting drones from flying over critical infrastructure, that has been expanded in the 85th and 86th legislative sessions. 



Every legislative session so far I have worked on making _Higher Education_ more accessible, cheaper, and efficient. I am most proud of my efforts in the 86th session which lead to the creation of a community college degree program for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.
